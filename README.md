 genetic algorithm toy code

 emulation on 
 virtual bots do cleaner work at 2D chessboard.
 only nearby cubes status the virtual bot could get. 
 that is he could see the cubes status of right\left\up\down and stand of his own. 
 the status of cubes could be a wall empty and have garbage
 So the bot should make decision on how to action.
 action must be move left/right/up/down or just clean the cube immediately.

 every bots have his algorithm to match all these circumstances. just like his own DNA.
 we just create these bots with random DNA injected and put he into 2D chessboard for limited steps testing.
 record the final score (more garbage gathering higher score)

 seleted high score bots and mix their DNA for next generation bots creation. 
 cycle these things. to get the bots with best strategy of do cleaning work.

 you could optimize the configs or strategy of DNA mixture.
 hope you like it.
 
 bobcat.
